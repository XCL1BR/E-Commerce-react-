## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
.
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   └── (individual component files)
├── pages/               # Dynamic pages for routing
│   └── (page files)
├── redux/               # State management using Redux
│   └── (redux files)
├── index.js             # Main entry point for the React application
├── package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md            # Project documentation (this file)
```

### Directory Descriptions
- **components/**: Contains all reusable components that can be used across various pages.
- **pages/**: Includes dynamic pages that define different routes in the application.
- **redux/**: Manages the global state of the application using Redux, including actions, reducers, and store configuration.
- **index.js**: The main entry point of the React application, where the app is initialized and rendered to the DOM.
